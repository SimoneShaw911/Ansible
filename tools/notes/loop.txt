# a loop is a powerful tool that allows you to execute a set of commands repeatedly
# example
	- changing permissions on hundreds of file
	- creating multiple user at once
	- installing many packages on hundreds of servers

# loops work hand in hand with conditions

# adding "loop" params
	- name:
	  hosts:
	  
	  tasks:
	  - name: create users
	    user:
		name: "{{ item }}"  
	    loop:
		- jerry
		- kramer
		- eliane

# adding variable

	- name:
	  hosts:
	  vars:
	    users: [jerry,kramer,eliane]

	  tasks:
	  - name: create users
	    user:
	      name: '{{item}}'
	    with_items: '{{users}}'
