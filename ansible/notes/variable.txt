#variables are containers that hold the defined value which can be used repetitively

#important things to remember
	- name can include letters, number, and underscore
	- name should start with a letter
	- cannot have spaces, dots (.), or hyphen (-) in variable name
	- can be defined in inventory files as well. (hosts file?)
        - when defining var must be in format:
			* notice in multi-vids spaces between var and brackets
					"{{ example }}"	
# defining variable in the playbook

	- name: Install some package
	  hosts:
	  var:
	   sespackage: sesquipedalianism
              [key]         [value]

	  tasks:
	  	- name: package install
		  yum:
		   name: "{{ sespackage }}"
		   state: present

		- name: Start service
		  service:
		   name: "{{ sespackage }}"
		   state: started

# var pair may be spaced for visability

- name:
  hosts:
  vars:
		sespackage: sesquipedalianism

# if i had a long playbook can use vairble to change item throug-out play with one change of key.

#example of how vars can make play cleaner or easier to write.
