# notes on roles

# when installing ansible a roles directory is created in the path /etc/ansible/roles.
# this is where you define roles by:
	- making directory for each role
		* can create roles based on server by naming directory after group/server
	- create sub-directory "tasks" within each directory
	- within task directory is where you define the yaml file that is the funtion of 
	  the role.
	- example: basic_install_httpd/tasks/main.yml
	            ^directory         ^dir  ^
					     ^ role

	- example: rolename/tasks(dir)/role-function

 
# Noticed a difference from playbooks. roles have NO HOSTS OR TASKS DEFINED in the yaml 
syntax.
	- example : ---                          - incorrect: ---
		    - name: install httpd      |              - name: install httpd
		      yum:                     |		hosts: all
			name: httpd           v|s               tasks:
			state: present         |		  - name: install httpd
                                               |                    yum:
                                               |                      name: httpd
								      state: present

# role make it easier to write playbook. how iterative can roles be in developing plays?
# must understand privilege escalation as it pertains to roles.
	currently:  use --become with -K
		    escalate througout play book as neccesary
	possible:?
		    change main.yml to task.yml then write to main
			---
			- { include: tasks.yml, become: yes }
